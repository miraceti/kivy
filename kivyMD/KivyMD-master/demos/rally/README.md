[Rally](https://material.io/design/material-studies/rally.html) is a personal finance app that uses **KivyMD** components and Material Theming to create an on-brand experience with a data-driven aesthetic. It is designed to display a large amount of densely organized information in a manageable way.

### A premium style
The dark gray UI gives Rally a premium feel, while also allowing its bright accent colors that represent data to stand out against the background. The high contrast between data and the background color make it easy to read its graphs and charts.
