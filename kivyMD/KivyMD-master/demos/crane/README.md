[Crane](https://material.io/design/material-studies/crane.html) is a travel app that uses **KivyMD** components and Material Theming to create a personalized, on-brand experience.

### Flexible aesthetic
Along with being both functional and informative, the Crane app provides a variety of filters to customize content so it's relevant to the user.

### Typography
Crane's type scale provides the typographic variety necessary for its app content. All items in the type scale use [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) as the typeface, making use of the variety of weights available with Raleway Light, Regular, Medium, and SemiBold.
